                                Abstract: This project aims to predict the future value of the financial stocks of a company. The main idea of the conducted survey study is to bring out the ideas related to the existing solution, while having the best accuracy and least error with appropriate parameters for the stock market prediction and information retrieval with a very affordable and approachable system for financial planning, risk profiling and stock prediction in one platform as a one-point destination for financial information and analytics. A recent survey by Script box of one of the major asset management companies, which is also an online mutual fund platform, found that about 72 percent of Indians are not aware of how to put aside their investments in order to achieve Financial Freedom. This includes people having no knowledge about personal finance, including risk profiling and investment instruments like stock market here. We are choosing stock market since this is one of the best instruments for our investments to work towards achieving Financial Freedom. In stock market prediction, the main aim is to predict the future value of a financial company stock. This has been done previously by few of machine learning algorithms, but our project is aiming on achieving fundamental analysis, rather than only technical where only previous closing values are taken to account. Whereas, in fundamental analysis we take into account a few more attributes including in earnings of the company before tax, Return on equity and few other factors.</p>

                                Abstract: Webpages are the sources of information in this vast internet world. Nowadays, for extracting some data, the webpages are becoming the key player. There are so many webpages containing information related to a specific categorized topic. Also, the text present on those webpages is vast and expressive. It takes minutes, hours, and even days to read and analyze the data. Our project aim is to make the user feel natural and comfortable to analyze the webpage, and the information contained in it. It’s an interactive platform for a user with a computer. Here, the webpage URL is taken as input, and the output can be the answers (both text and audio output) for the questions asked by the user and some interactive sentences.</p>

                                Abstract: Data analysis and mining are playing a crucial role in today's business world of innovative organizations. The data is one of the essential factors to analyze trends and marketing strategies in business. Moreover, most of the data available on earth are unstructured sources, i.e., audio, images, images in motion(videos), and many followed. These unstructured data sources also contain information that is furthermore used for data analysis and learning. Most of the online videos we see in our day to-day life have more data to get information on a specific range of topics. YouTube videos can also be used as unstructured sources to gain knowledge by formatting them in a structured way. In this project, we created a software program that can extract information from the YouTube video. Mainly, there are two types of content collected from the YouTube video: video details like title of the video, views, likes and dislikes count, tags linked, description attached to the video, and many other elements seen in YouTube videos webpage. The other type of content is a summary of the video based on the text obtained from speech attached to the YouTube video.</p>

                                Abstract: The purpose of this software development project is to create a new application called: "Library Management System". The client for this project wishes to enter the PC-based internet environment. The Library Management System will be PC-base with internet, allowing library users to search for books, view previously borrowed book, manage wallet, extend currently borrowed booking and library staff members to manage the book inventory and user database. The application will provide the following capabilities: <br><br>
                                The application will be access via internet on a PC/Mobile at any place. User will be able to manage library user accounts including updating details, extend the booking of currently held book, adding and viewing balance in wallet and also view previous borrowed book details. Library staff will be able to manage the book inventory database including remove, change, and add. The application will provide search function on books based on genre, title, author, year.<br><br>
                                The project's client has determined that this application will provide the following benefits:<br>
                                • Provide additional flexibility and convenience to the library users.<br>
                                • Provide better reliability and security of the library information.<br>
                                • Provide a more productive environment for the library staff member.<br>
                                • Reduce the cost of the library operations.<br><br>
                                The availability of information at any time in any place.</p>

On implementing web scraping technique in this application, we can make it to extract the data from a particular set of profiles and store them in a table (csv) format. Once the data get collected, it is stored in a table format, data obtained is shared to an organization or persons e-mail ID according to the requirement.

                            Abstract: In this project, our goal is to correctly predict whether a given individual makes a profit of greater than $50,000 or less than $50,000 based on a set of attribute features which are already provided from the adult_income dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>. This model can help non-profit organizations which certainly depends on donation to correctly predict the donation that the organization has to request an individual based on the individual records. So, with the data available we can come to conclusion that an individual can be a donor or not.</p>

                            Abstract: The concept was developed from the traditional snakes and ladders game; a pair of persons can play this game. The message box was added benefit for the project which will showcase several actions that occurs while playing game such as – player details, snakes, ladders, cell number, victory, etc. instead designing actual snakes and ladders on the board. The dice can be operated by pressing the left arrow (Player-1) and right arrow (Player-2) using the physical keyboard. Finally who can reach the 64th cell first will get the victory title.</p>
